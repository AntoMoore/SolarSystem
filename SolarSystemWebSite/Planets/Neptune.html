					<h4>Neptune: In Depth</h4>
					
					<p>The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than through regular observations of the sky. 
					(Galileo had recorded it as a fixed star during observations with his small telescope in 1612 and 1613.) When Uranus didn't travel exactly 
					as astronomers expected it to, a French mathematician, Urbain Joseph Le Verrier, proposed the position and mass of another as yet unknown 
					planet that could cause the observed changes to Uranus' orbit.</p>
					
					<p>After being ignored by French astronomers, Le Verrier sent his predictions to 
					Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory, who found Neptune on his first night of searching in 1846. Seventeen days later, its 
					largest moon, Triton, was also discovered.</p>
					
					<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
					
					<p>The most distant planet from the sun, Neptune is the third most massive. Despite its great size, it was the last planet to be discovered, because it lies so far away.</p>
					
					<p>Neptune is the fourth largest planet in terms of diameter, making it the smallest in physical size of the gas giants. The average distance from the center of the planet to its surface is 
					15,299 miles (24,622 kilometers). But like most spinning bodies, Neptune's rotation causes it to bulge slightly around the equator.</p>

					<h4>Orbit and Rotation</h4>
					
					<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. 
					Interestingly, the highly eccentric orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years. </p>
					
					<p>Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two 
					bodies.</p>

						<p class="para-position">The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. 
						Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during 
						each rotation because of this misalignment.</p>

						<p class="para-position">Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's 
						and nine times stronger than Earth's. In 1989, Voyager 2 tracked a large, oval-shaped, dark storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere. This 
						"Great Dark Spot" was large enough to contain the entire Earth, spun counterclockwise, and moved westward at almost 1,200 kilometers 
						(750 miles) per hour. </p>
