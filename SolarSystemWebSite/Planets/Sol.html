					<h4>Sun: In Depth</h4>
					
					<p>The sun at the heart of our solar system is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases. 
					Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles 
					of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar 
					system by the solar wind — a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the sun in all directions.</p>
					
					<p>The connection and interactions between the sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, 
					radiation belts and aurorae. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our sun scattered across 
					the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
					
					<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
					
					<p>With a radius of 432,168.6 miles (695,508 kilometers), our sun is not an especially large star — many are several 
					times bigger — but it is still far more massive than our home planet: 332,946 Earths match the mass of the sun. The 
					sun's volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it.</p>
					
					<p>The sun is 93 million miles (about 150,000,000 kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha 
					Centauri triple star system: Proxima Centauri is 2.24 light years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B — two stars 
					orbiting each other — are 4.37 light years away. A light year is the distance light travels in one year, which is 
					equal to 5,878,499,810,000 miles or 9,460,528,400,000 kilometers.</p>

					<h4>Orbit and Rotation</h4>
					
					<p>The sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our sun is in a 
					spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm. From there, the sun orbits the 
					center of the Milky Way Galaxy, bringing the planets, asteroids, comets and other objects along with it. Our solar 
					system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this 
					speed, it takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way.</p>
