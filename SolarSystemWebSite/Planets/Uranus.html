					<h4>Uranus: In Depth</h4>
					
					<p>The seventh planet from the sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded 
					by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear 
					to spin on its side, orbiting the sun like a rolling ball.</p>
					
					<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. 
					It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.</p>
					
					<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
					
					<p>With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.</p>
					
					<p>From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance 
					from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the sun to Uranus.</p>

					<h4>Orbit and Rotation</h4>
					
					<p>One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours (the time it takes for Uranus to rotate or spin once). And Uranus makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth 
					years (30,687 Earth days).</p>
					
					<p>Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees — possibly the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. 
					This unique tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the 
					planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter.</p>

							<td>18 Mar 2011:</td>
							<td>New Horizons passes the orbit of Uranus on its way to Pluto, becoming the first spacecraft to journey beyond Uranus' orbit since Voyager 2. 
							However, Uranus was not near the crossing point. The spacecraft is asleep during most of its eight-year interplanetary trek from Jupiter to Pluto.</td>

						<p class="para-position">Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made 
						up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia - above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit 
						(4,982 degrees Celsius).</p>

						<p class="para-position">Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives 
						Uranus its signature blue color. While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986, more recent 
						observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features.</p>
