					<h4>Jupiter: In Depth</h4>
					
					<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our sun and the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are cold, windy clouds of 
					ammonia and water. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, and its iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged 
					for hundreds of years.</p>
					
					<p>Jupiter is surrounded by 53 confirmed moons, as well as 16 provisional ones — for a possible total of 69 moons. Scientists are most interested in the 
					"Galilean satellites" — the four largest moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Europa, Callisto, Ganymede and Io. Jupiter also has three rings, but 
					they are very hard to see and not nearly as intricate as Saturn's.</p>
					
					<p>Jupiter is named for the king of ancient Roman gods.</p>
					
					<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
					
					<p>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as 
					big as a basketball.</p>
					
					<p>From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit 
					(abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the sun to Jupiter.</p>

					<h4>Orbit and Rotation</h4>
					
					<p>Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), 
					and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).</p>
					
					<p>Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as 
					extreme as other planets do.</p>

						<p class="para-position">The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the sun — mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure
